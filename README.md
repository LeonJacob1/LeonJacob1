- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LeonJacob1
- I am currently applying for jobs in data analytics, since I am very passionate about statistics since my master's degree.
- Right now I am learning to code in python through a course on udemy. So far I picked up quite a bit of knowledge in classification such as KNN, Logistic Regression or SVM.
